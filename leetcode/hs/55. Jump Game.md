# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My first Thought was using queue: Insert possible nodes, and also check visited. But pushing "every possible nodes" was unnecessary.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The Point is how many possible jumps at "current index"
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(N)
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums[0];
        int next = 0;
        while(true) {
            if(next == nums.size()-1) return true;
            if(len == 0) return false;
            len--;
            next += 1;
            if(nums[next] >= len) len = nums[next];
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
